This project is a website that allows managers of multiple office pools to run them all
from one location.  There are currently three types of pool built: pick 'em leagues, 
suicide/survivor pools and confidence pools.

I built this application for two reasons:

1. To learn Ruby and Rails. 
2. Because I was tired of hosting all my office pools from multiple locations and spreadsheets.

I'm proud of this application because I achieved both those goals in at least some fashion.
I built, tested and deployed an application using Ruby on Rails that allowed me to spend more time
watching football and less time managing the pools.  This project also taught me about git and Heroku.

As my first major Rails project, I'm thrilled with the end result.  It's the first application I've built
for myself that can feasibly be used by other people as well and I'm very proud of that.
